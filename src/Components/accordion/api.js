        question: 'What is Olympus?',
        answer: `OHM, governed by the Olympus DAO, is Web3’s decentralized reserve currency. OHM’s purpose is to provide the growing Web3 financial ecosystem with a censorship-resistant currency that preserves purchasing power, has deep liquidity, is trusted and used widely as a unit of account. OHM is supported by a robust and growing Treasury, which acts as a counterbalance to the market, adding confidence and stability to a volatile system.`

        question:'What is the goal of Olympus?',
        answer: `Our goal is to build a policy-controlled financial reserve currency that:
        — Preserves purchasing power via long-term price stability
        — Has deep liquidity across decentralized and centralized exchanges
        — Is utilized as a unit of account (e.g., by being paired against many other assets in Web3)
        — Is utilized as trusted backing (e.g., to collateralize other assets or deposited into protocols’ treasuries).`

        question:'Why do we need Olympus in the first place?',
        answer:`Dollar-pegged stablecoins have become an essential part of crypto due to their lack of volatility as compared to tokens such as Bitcoin and Ether. Users are comfortable with transacting using stablecoins knowing that they hold the same amount of purchasing power today vs. tomorrow. But this is a fallacy. The dollar is controlled by the US government and the Federal Reserve. This means a depreciation of the dollar also means a depreciation of these stablecoins. Olympus aims to solve Web3’s reliance on centralized, censorable stablecoin assets by creating a non-pegged reserve currency called OHM that is backed by a basket of assets. Olympus actively utilizes its Treasury as a counterbalance to the market  and to grow the econOHMy.`,

        question:'Is OHM a stable coin?',
        answer:`No, OHM is not a stable coin. Our goal is to develop a Web3-native asset that helps users preserve purchasing power, has deep liquidity across the ecosystem, is utilized broadly as a unit of account and serves as a trusted backing for other decentralized assets.`,

        question:'Is OHM pegged?',
        answer:`Unlike stablecoins, OHM is not pegged to any fiat currency. Instead, it is backed by $200M+ worth of assets in the Olympus Treasury, ensuring confidence and stability via the RBS monetary policy. Learn more about <a>{RBS}</a>.`
